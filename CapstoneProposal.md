## Capstone Project Proposal
_submitted 12/18/18_    

#### Premise
An earlier study of Kickstarter data determined that a campaign designated as a ‘staff pick’ has an almost 10% greater chance of reaching its funding goal.  My project is to examine the same datasets to try and extract information about Kickstarter projects that were selected as a ‘staff pick’.

A link to the earlier study of Kickstarter data is here:

#### Potential Clients
Anyone who is planning to crowdfund a project on Kickstarter.  Project creators can design their funding campaigns based around the ‘staff pick’ parameters for the best possible chance of success.  

#### Datasets

Here is a link to another Kickstarter prediction study that explains the nature of the datasets:

There are other Kickstarter datasets available that may or may not be derived from the webrobots source:

#### Methodology  
Examine Kickstarter datasets created over a three-year period describing campaigns designated as a ‘staff pick’.  Explore how categorical & location distribution, experience of project creator, and length of campaign correlates to the ‘staff pick’ designation.  


#### Deliverables  
Final project elements consist of documented code, a summary report, and a slideshow presentation.
